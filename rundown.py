""" 
*.rview is just a pickle file:
Pickle in Python is primarily used in serializing and deserializing a Python object structure. 
In other words, itâ€™s the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it 
in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network. 
The pickled byte stream can be used to re-create the original object hierarchy by unpickling 
the stream. This whole process is similar to object serialization in Java or .Net.
"""

ie.

data looks like this
[
    [datetime, float, float],
    [datetime, float, float],
    ...
    [datetime, float, float]
]

or a practical example:

[
    [Timestamp('2022-08-11 15:59:58-0400', tz='tzoffset(None, -14400)'), 33331.36, 324.08]

    [Timestamp('2022-08-11 16:00:00-0400', tz='tzoffset(None, -14400)'), 33341.71, 324.37]
]

Timestamp and datetime are practically the same class or object type in terms of functionality.

meaning events looks something like this:

[
    StrategyEvent(time=`some datetime object`, name=`name of the event`,
